# Efficient-Comparing-of-Strings-usingSHA256-hash-funciton
Comparing equality of 2 strings. The function runs in constant time irrespective of the input length, a significant improvement over many algorithms.


## I will upload a comparitive analysis in the future examining accurately how much better the algorithm is.
